      <description>My name is Csaba Fitzl or also known as &amp;ldquo;theevilbit&amp;rdquo;, which comes from RFC 3514. I graduated in 2006 as a computer engineer. I have worked for 6 years as a network engineer, troubleshooting and designing big networks. After that, I have worked for 8 years as a blue and red teamer focusing on network forensics, malware analysis, adversary simulation, and defense bypasses. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working as a content developer at Offensive Security.</description>
