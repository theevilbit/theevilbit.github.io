      <description>When I originally found the mount_apfs bug back in December, 2019 I honestly had no idea what was the root cause for, nor had a clue how to even start looking into it. The only thing I knew for sure that the answer is within kernel. My macOS knowledge was still quite fresh that time (and even today), and was busy with so many other stuff that I never had the time to start looking into it.</description>
