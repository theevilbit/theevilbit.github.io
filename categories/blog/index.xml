      <title>CVE-2022-22655 - TCC - Location Services Bypass</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-22655/</link>

      <description>This is a quick blogpost about a vulnerability I covered in our Black Hat Europe 2022 talk with Wojciech Regula.
In contrary to what people would expect, clients which can access location services are not maintained in one of the TCC databased, but in a separate location, and it&amp;rsquo;s maintained by locationd. This has been also recently covered by Howard Oakley, in his Privacy: what TCC does and doesn’t blogpost.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-32929 - Bypass iOS backup&#39;s TCC protection</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-32929/</link>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-32929/</guid>
      <description>Intro Normally, when a users backup their iOS device, the backup is saved into ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup directory. The MobileSync directory is properly protected by TCC, as the backup can contain photos, contact information, everything from the iOS device, and it might be unencrypted, so this is a whole lot of private information. It&amp;rsquo;s only accessible with Full Disk Access rights.
The issue is that an attacker can invoke the AppleMobileBackup utility and make a backup to a custom location.</description>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2017-2533/</guid>
      <description>Intro CVE-2017-2533 was part of a chain of vulnerabilities, used at pwn2own 2017 found by the phoenhex team. They wrote a blogpost about it here. This vulnerability led me to find CVE-2022-32780, which I detailed at Black Hat Asia 2022. Although the nature of CVE-2017-2533 was discussed by the authors, but the actual code part was never truly revealed, and I always wondered about the full details. Now I took the time to dig up the details, including how it was fixed, and why the fix solves the problem.</description>

      <description>Dropping some initial quick notes for a new security feature I ran into on macOS Ventura. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Launch Constraints&amp;rdquo; and lives inside AMFI.
Do the following experiment: Copy Terminal.app to your HOME folder and try to run it on Monterey and Ventura. On the former it will work without any issues, on the other it will fail, and we will get the following error:
2022-06-14 05:59:55.254678+0200 0x5481 Default 0x0 0 0 kernel: (AppleMobileFileIntegrity) AMFI: Launch Constraint Violation (enforcing), error info: c[1]p[1]m[1]e[2], (Constraint not matched) launching proc[vc: 1 pid: 1112]: /Users/ace/Terminal.</description>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2021-30808/</guid>
      <description>Intro CVE-2021-1784 was a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to bypass TCC by mounting over the ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC directory and providing a new TCC database. We covered this with Wojciech Regula in or 20+ ways to bypass your mac os privacy mechanisms BlackHat USA talk. This was properly fixed in Big Sur.
The Vulnerability I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I started to experiment with it again in the very first version of Monterey beta, and found that although the exploit doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, we can mount over the ~/Library directory.</description>

      <description>Many people used to ask me where to start learning about macOS security or exploitation, what are the trainings or books out there that can help with this topic. Nowadays there are a few trainings, which can get you started. Other great resources for macOS security are blog posts and conference talks.
I thought I will try to collect some resources that can help people to get started in this field.</description>

      <description>This post is about two techniques that can be useful for someone to evade GateKeeper in a red team engagement or pentest. According to Apple these are not considered bypasses, and everything works as expected.
mmap Part of GateKeeper is implemented on macOS in the Quarantine.kext kernel extension. It uses the MAC policy framework to insert hooks on the system on various points. These functions are named as hook*. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look on what is implemented.</description>

      <description>Apple announced macOS Monterey (macOS 12) this week at WWDC, and one of its new features that caught my eye is Shortcuts. It&amp;rsquo;s already available on iOS, but it made its way to macOS. My security focused brain immediately thought about how cool this feature could be for red teamers or pentesters to persist on macOS :) So I decided to take a quick look on the new functionality, focusing on how it works.</description>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/teamviewer_lpe/</guid>
      <description>Intro This is a rather old vulnerability I found in TeamViewer back in 2020, and reported it through VCP/iDefense. TeamViewer fixed the vulnerability last November, but somehow I missed it, and became aware of it only recently. Their advisory can be found here: November updates - Security patches — TeamViewer Support
The TeamViewer macOS client used a PrivilegedHelperTool named com.teamviewer.Helper to perform specific tasks that require root permissions. Back in 2020 it used a deprecate model to perform IPC communication, called Distributed Objects.</description>

      <description>Since Apple started their Apple Security Bounty program I have submitted around 50 cases to their product security team. I thought I will share my experiences working with Apple in the past 2 years. This will be useful to anyone thinking about participating in the program, and will help setting up expectations.
Beyond Apple I do bug bounties also in other programs, like HackerOne, BugCrowd, VCP, ZDI or sometimes just working directly with vendors, so I have a good pool of other cases I can compare to.</description>

      <description>I plan to discuss two symlink attacks in this blog post. The first, more severe one, CVE-2020-9900 was reported by Zhongcheng Li (CK01) of Zero-dayits Team of Legendsec at Qi&amp;rsquo;anxin Group, and fixed in Catalina 10.15.6. Apple&amp;rsquo;s advisory said that with a symlink attack it was possible to elevate privileges. I never saw a public document about this bug, so I only assume that I will describe the actual issue here.</description>

      <description>TL;DR On macOS 10.15.2 Apple introduced the com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation entitlement, which is slowly replacing the previously used com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation entitlement on system binaries. Although their impact is the about the same, the way they work is different. While library validation is automatically disabled using com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation, with com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation, the application has to disable it for itself through a csops system call.
Intro With the release of Big Sur, I noticed that many of the system binaries have a new entitlement, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t see before, and that is com.</description>

      <description>TL;DR This blog post describes a generic technique I called internally on our red team assessment &amp;ldquo;Divide and Conquer&amp;rdquo;, which can be used to bypass behavioral based NextGen AV detection. It works by splitting malicious actions and API calls into distinct processes.
Intro Back in 2019 I was part of a red team, where our daily activity was to bypass a specific NextGen AV. I had this idea I called &amp;ldquo;divide and conquer&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>When I originally found the mount_apfs bug back in December, 2019, I honestly had no idea what was the root cause of it, nor had a clue how to even start looking into it. The only thing I knew for sure that the answer is within kernel. My macOS knowledge was still quite fresh that time (and even today), and was busy with so many other stuff that I never had the time to start looking into it.</description>

      <description>This blog post shares the details of a vulnerability Offensive Security discovered in the XPC service of Microsoft Teams. Although Microsoft secured these services reasonably well, we will see how small code mistakes can have serious impacts.
We reported the issue to MSRC, but unfortunately Microsoft decided that “the finding is valid but does not meet our bar for immediate servicing.” While they have since hardened the XPC service, it remains exploitable.</description>

      <description>This is a blog post I wanted to write for a while now, but somehow never got the time for it, and I also knew that it will require lots of time, so I kept delaying it. I finally kicked my ass, sat down, and wrote it.
The goal of the post is to cover many aspects of authorization, which I found interesting from security perspective. Honestly, partially for selfish reasons so I will have a goto summary when I need to lookup something later instead of browsing through 8-10 different articles.</description>

      <description>TL;DR We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the noowners flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc&amp;hellip;) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple&amp;rsquo;s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱
This could be achieved with a single command, for example: mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.</description>

      <description>In the last post of the series we will see another typical issue, where XPC services using the connecting process&amp;rsquo;s ID (PID) to verify the client instead of the audit token. We will use F-Secure SAFE again for our case study, the vulnerability was fixed in 17.8 and it was assigned CVE-2020-14977.
The root cause The XPC services of F-Secure SAFE use the process ID (PID) to verify the client&amp;rsquo;s signature, as can be seen in the code below.</description>

      <description>F-Secure SAFE XPC service exploitation (CVE-2020-14978) Intro In this post we will look into an other case study which will show us (again) why XPC client verification is crucial in XPC security, and how added authorization checks can slightly improve (but not fix) the problem. The F-Secure SAFE XPC services installed on macOS were not sufficiently hardened, and a malicious actor had the ability to interact with them. The vulnerability was fixed in version 17.</description>

      <description>On macOS, one popular technique to inject code into other applications is leveraging the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable, which I wrote about in 2019 DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES DYLIB injection in macOS / OSX. This variable can store a colon-separated list of dynamic libraries to load before the ones specified in the target process.
Several limitations apply to when this injection technique can be used and when it cannot, which I also discussed. I revisited this topic, not only because things might have changed since then but also to ensure that I didn’t miss anything.</description>

      <description>Microsoft AutoUpdate macOS privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2020-0984) Introduction This is the third post in my series which is trying to help Apple developers to avoid typical insecure coding practices. This one will highlight why XPC client hardening and proper verification is extremely important when we use XPC messaging on macOS between clients that run as a normal user and services that run as root. If this validation is not right, it opens up the possibility for an attacker to run privileged commands or worse case, achieve full privilege escalation on the system.</description>

      <description>As security researchers, we often find ourselves needing to look deep into various kernels to fully understand our target and accomplish our goals. Doing so on the Windows platform is no mystery, as there have been countless well-written posts about kernel debugging setups. For macOS, however, the situation is slightly different.
There are many great posts describing how to set up kernel debugging between two machines, but all of them suggest that SIP (System Integrity Protection) should be disabled for kernel debugging.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for some bug fixes to release the previously planned posts, and in the meantime I continue to poke at other PrivilegedHelperTools. This post born because I actually failed to exploit an XPC service, and I learned something new in regards, of how to securely write such a service. One application that came to my sight is Viscosity. This tool was already in Tyler Bohan&amp;rsquo;s list, where his team looked on exploiting such services: GitHub - blankwall/Offensive-Con: Talk and materials for Offensive Con presentation - Privileged Helper Tools.</description>

      <description>This research started around summer time in 2019, when everything settled down after my talk in 2019, where I detailed how did I gained root privileges via a benign App Store application, that I developed. That exploit used a symlink to achieve this, so I though I will make a more general approach and see if this type of vulnerability exists in other places as well on macOS systems. As it turns out it does exists, and not just on macOS directly but also on other apps, it appears to be a very fruitful of issue, without too much effort I found 5 exploitable bugs on macOS, 3 in Adobe installers.</description>

      <description>This is the first part of a blog post series I plan about PrivilegedHelperTools that exists on macOS systems. I recently took a look on a couple of these tools, and found that it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to make the code insecure, as there are many small pieces to it, and if one is done wrong, the helper tool will be open to abuse by anyone having a foothold on the system.</description>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/gatekeeper_bypass_or_not_bypass/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR On macOS Mojave Gatekeeper only verifies executables, which are run with the open command or the user double clicks. It won’t verify files, that are executed through other means like, directly executing a binary ./myapp regardless of the quarantine attribute. If you can place a plist file inside LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons, the command inside will also be executed. Prior to Catalina there is a way to trick users to drag &amp;amp; drop files in the LaunchAgents folder.</description>

      <description>IOBit’s Unlocker program is advertised to solve the following issues:
IObit Unlocker performs well in solving “cannot delete files”, “access is denied”, “The file is in use by another program or user”, or “There has been a sharing violation” problems. With IObit Unlocker, you can manage all your files the way you want.
and even:
With “Unlock &amp;amp; Delete”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Rename”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Move”, and “Unlock &amp;amp; Copy”, IObit Unlocker offers easier ways to unlock and manage the files and folders to keep them safe and available.</description>

      <description>TL;DR The GitHub Desktop app doesn’t add the quarantine extended attribute to files downloaded from the web, and this along with macOS’s URL handler auto-registration feature allows an attacker to execute arbitrary, even unsigned code on a macOS system. If we don’t count the clicks required to open the GitHub App, and cloning an external repository, then this is a 2 click RCE.
The idea I recently came across a very good blog post about an RCE vulnerability on GitHub Desktop: GitHub Desktop RCE (OSX) - André Baptista via its custom URL handlers.</description>

      <description>Whenever you install an application on Windows, typically through MSI, there is a registry key created, with plenty of information for uninstallation, like the uninstaller location, install date, publisher, etc… you can find all of the options here: Add uninstall information to Add/Remove Programs - NSIS
In case an application is installed for the current user and not for all user, the Installation/Uninstallation details will go to the Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\ registry key instead of the HKLM hive.</description>

      <title>A simple protection against HMValidateHandle technique</title>

      <description>In the recent days I was reading technical analysis of win32k exploits from recent years, and it caught my eyes, that the HMValidateHandle technique is very heavily used almost everywhere. Then I had an idea how to protect against this family of exploits, which I think is very simple. This post will be about that.
What is HMValidateHandle? HMValidateHandle is an internal, unexported function of user32.dll. It takes a handle and a handle type as arguments, and by looking up the handle table, if the handle is matching with the type it will copy the object to user memory.</description>

      <title>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES DYLIB injection in macOS / OSX</title>

      <description>After my recent blog post, my old mate @_Dark_Knight_ reached out to me and he asked me a question:
“Do you typically callout user apps that allow dyld_insert_libraries?”
And a few similar ones, and I will be honest, I had no idea what is he talking about, if only I understood the question :D Despite the fact that my recent blog posts and talks are about macOS, I deal much more with Windows on a daily basis, probably like 95%, and macOS is still a whole new territory for me.</description>

      <title>TALK - macOS - Getting root with benign AppStore apps</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/getting_root_with_benign_appstore_apps/</link>

      <description>This writeup is intended to be a bit of storytelling. I would like to show how I went down the rabbit hole in a quick ’research’ I wanted to do, and eventually found a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. I also want to show, tell about all the obstacles and failures I run into, stuff that people don’t talk about usually, but I feel it’s part of the process all of us go through, when we try to create something.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-14976 - GNS3 ubridge SETUID bit - arbitrary file read</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea of scanning my Mac for files that has the SUID bit set, I wanted to see if there is anything interesting showing up. You can do it this way:
/usr/bin/sudo find / -perm -4000 -exec /bin/ls -ldb {} \; &amp;gt; suidfilelist There was one item that caught my attention, and that was a file called ubridge inside GNS3. I used to be a network guy, and GNS3 is a great tool to emulate real network gear, practice configuration, etc.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-5514 - VMware Fusion 11 - Guest VM RCE</title>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/vmware_fusion_11_guest_vm_rce_cve-2019-5514/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR You can run an arbitrary command on a VMware Fusion guest VM through a website without any priory knowledge. Basically VMware Fusion is starting up a websocket listening only on the localhost. You can fully control all the VMs (also create/delete snapshots, whatever you want) through this websocket interface, including launching apps. You need to have VMware Tools installed on the guest for launching apps, but honestly who doesn’t have it installed.</description>
