      <description>Intro Link to heading This is a rather old vulnerability I found in TeamViewer back in 2020, and reported it through VCP/iDefense. TeamViewer fixed the vulnerability last November, but somehow I missed it, and became aware of it only recently. Their advisory can be found here: November updates - Security patches â€” TeamViewer Support
The TeamViewer macOS client used a PrivilegedHelperTool named com.teamviewer.Helper to perform specific tasks that require root permissions.</description>
