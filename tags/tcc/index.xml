      <description>Intro Link to heading CVE-2023-40424 is a vulnerability that allows a root-level user to create a new user with a custom Transparency Consent and Control (TCC) database in macOS, which can then be used to access other users’ private data.&#xA;First discovered back in 2022, the vulnerability was fixed by Apple in 2023 in macOS Sonoma’s initial release. But it was not fixed in earlier versions of macOS—one more reason users and admins should update their Mac computers to Sonoma.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-22655 - TCC - Location Services Bypass</title>

      <description>This is a quick blogpost about a vulnerability I covered in our Black Hat Europe 2022 talk with Wojciech Regula.&#xA;In contrary to what people would expect, clients which can access location services are not maintained in one of the TCC databased, but in a separate location, and it&amp;rsquo;s maintained by locationd. This has been also recently covered by Howard Oakley, in his Privacy: what TCC does and doesn’t blogpost.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-32929 - Bypass iOS backup&#39;s TCC protection</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-32929/</link>

      <description>Intro Link to heading Normally, when a users backup their iOS device, the backup is saved into ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup directory. The MobileSync directory is properly protected by TCC, as the backup can contain photos, contact information, everything from the iOS device, and it might be unencrypted, so this is a whole lot of private information. It&amp;rsquo;s only accessible with Full Disk Access rights.&#xA;The issue is that an attacker can invoke the AppleMobileBackup utility and make a backup to a custom location.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-30808 - CVE-2021-1784 strikes back - TCC bypass via mounting</title>

      <description>Intro Link to heading CVE-2021-1784 was a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to bypass TCC by mounting over the ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC directory and providing a new TCC database. We covered this with Wojciech Regula in or 20+ ways to bypass your mac os privacy mechanisms BlackHat USA talk. This was properly fixed in Big Sur.&#xA;The Vulnerability Link to heading I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I started to experiment with it again in the very first version of Monterey beta, and found that although the exploit doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, we can mount over the ~/Library directory.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-9771 - mount_apfs TCC bypass and privilege escalation</title>

      <description>TL;DR Link to heading We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the noowners flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc&amp;hellip;) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple&amp;rsquo;s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱&#xA;This could be achieved with a single command, for example: mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.</description>
