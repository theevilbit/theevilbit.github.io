        <p>This is a blog post I wanted to write for a while now, but somehow never got the time for it, and I also knew that it will require lots of time, so I kept delaying it. I finally kicked my ass, sat down, and wrote it.</p>
<p>The goal of the post is to cover many aspects of authorization, which I found interesting from security perspective. Honestly, partially for selfish reasons so I will have a goto summary when I need to lookup something later instead of browsing through 8-10 different articles. All of these information I try catch here in one post, are known, but spread all over the place in various blog posts and articles, and I never found a good, central location with all the details. Also some of the items are very confusing and it took me some time to clear things in my head as not everything is obvious or intuitive.</p>
<p>When I talk about authorization here, I mean the user mode authorization on macOS, which is handled by the <code>authd</code>process. There is also a kernel authorization framework, <code>kauth</code>, but this post is not about that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>
<h2 id="main-authorization-concept">
  Main authorization concept
  <a class="heading-link" href="#main-authorization-concept">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>I think the concepts are best described at Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/authorization_concepts/02authconcepts/authconcepts.html"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authorization Concepts</a> documentation. It&rsquo;s rather old, but still valid.</p>
<p>There is an authorization database on the system, with various rights, that can be asked for, and if the requirement are satisfied, authorization will be granted and the asked right will be given. Based on this it might sound that an authorization could give extra rights to our process, which is both true and false at the same time. Let&rsquo;s discuss first why it&rsquo;s not true, as I think this is the more confusing part.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say <strong>Process A</strong> runs as a regular user and asks for the <strong>Right X</strong>, which is required to perform <strong>Task A</strong>. Let&rsquo;s also assume that in order to perform <strong>Task A</strong> a process has to run as root, because it needs to write to a location where only root has access. Now, after obtaining <strong>Right X</strong>, will our process be able to perform <strong>Task A</strong>? The answer is: <del>NO</del>. It still runs as the standard user, which has no write access to that location. How can it still perform <strong>Task A</strong>? It can ask <strong>Process B</strong>, which runs as root, to perform <strong>Task A</strong> with showing the authorization <strong>Right X</strong>, which will be verified by <strong>Process B</strong>. If it can&rsquo;t obtain the right <strong>Process B</strong> will deny the request.</p>
<p>This example can also be done in another way. We only have <strong>Process B</strong> running as root. Prior to executing <strong>Task A</strong>, it will try to obtain the authorization <strong>Right X</strong>, and if successful it will do the task.</p>
<p>These examples show that authorization is a self-restrictive model, which means that our standard POSIX processes won&rsquo;t have more privileges when obtaining a right but they can limit themselves to perform specific actions and tie it to an authorization right. I think this is crucial to understand going forward.</p>
<p>The authorization rights that can be obtained are stored in the authorization database, which we will discuss next.</p>
<h2 id="the-authorization-database">
  The authorization database
  <a class="heading-link" href="#the-authorization-database">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The default authorization PLIST file is located at <code>/System/Library/Security/authorization.plist</code>. This is the file that is used to initialize the SQLITE3 authorization database, which is located at <code>/var/db/auth.db</code>. The database is only readable and writeable for the root user. We have two ways to read and write to this database.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the <code>security</code> command line tool</li>
<li>Using <code>sqlite3</code> directly on the database</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>security</code> command line tool has an <code>authorizationdb</code> argument which allows reading and writing to the DB. We can read as a normal user from the database using this tool, for any modifications we need to run it as root. Using <code>sqlite3</code> will only work if we run it as root, because of the file permissions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review method one first. Here is an example reading out the <code>system.preferences.accounts</code> right, which is the right required to make changes to users.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>csaby@mac ~ % security authorizationdb read system.preferences.accounts
&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &#34;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&#34; &#34;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&#34;&gt;
&lt;plist version=&#34;1.0&#34;&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;allow-root&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;true/&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;authenticate-user&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;true/&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;class&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;user&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;comment&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;Checked by the Admin framework when making changes to the Users &amp;amp; Groups preference pane.&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;created&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;real&gt;609094350.06486595&lt;/real&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;group&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;admin&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;modified&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;real&gt;609094350.06486595&lt;/real&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;session-owner&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;false/&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;shared&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;false/&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;timeout&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;2147483647&lt;/integer&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;tries&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;10000&lt;/integer&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;version&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
YES (0)
</code></pre><p>We get back a typical PLIST representation. We will review some of the key parts of the entry. The <code>class</code> key is set to <code>user</code>, which means that it&rsquo;s a user based right. <code>allow-root</code> being set to <code>true</code> means that the right will be granted for root, without any further authentication. The <code>authenticate-user</code> means to authenticate the user for this right, however this will be only effective if the user is in the <code>admin</code> group as specified later under the <code>group</code> key. This means that if our user is in this group, we can be authenticated, and if that is successful the right will be granted.</p>
<p>There is another type of <code>class</code> for authorization, and it&rsquo;s not <code>user</code>, but <code>rule</code> based. The <code>config.remove.</code> right is an example for this.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>csaby@mac ~ % security authorizationdb read config.remove.
&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &#34;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&#34; &#34;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&#34;&gt;
&lt;plist version=&#34;1.0&#34;&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;class&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;rule&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;comment&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;Wildcard right for deleting rights.  Admins are allowed to delete any (non-wildcard) rights.  Root does not require authentication.&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;created&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;real&gt;609094350.06486595&lt;/real&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;k-of-n&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;modified&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;real&gt;609094350.06486595&lt;/real&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;rule&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;array&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;is-root&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;authenticate-admin&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;/array&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;version&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
YES (0)
</code></pre><p>Here we can see the authorization <code>class</code> is set to <code>rule</code>, and later on we have a <code>rule</code> key, which stores, well&hellip; rules. Here it&rsquo;s set to <code>is-root</code> and <code>authenticate-admin</code>. This means that the root user, and admin users after authentication can get this right.</p>
<p>There is also a <code>k-of-n</code> key, which specifies how many of the rules specified in the army has to be satisfied for granting the rule. In this case it&rsquo;s <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>There is another important authorization class, which is <code>allow</code>,  and the <code>config.add.</code> right is a good example for this. This class means that anyone can get the right.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>csaby@mac ~ % security authorizationdb read config.add.   
&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt;

&lt;dict&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;class&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;allow&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;comment&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;Wildcard right for adding rights.  Anyone is allowed to add any (non-wildcard) rights.&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;created&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;real&gt;609094350.06486595&lt;/real&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;modified&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;real&gt;609094350.06486595&lt;/real&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;version&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
YES (0)
</code></pre><p>This specific right is required to add an entry to the authorization database.</p>
<p>There are other classes, like <code>evaluate-mechanisms</code>, which will list several <code>mechanisms</code>, which will be handled by various authorization plugins. I won&rsquo;t discuss this topic here. For the <code>rule</code> based rights, there are many other options to specify under the key, like <code>entitled</code> or <code>entitled-admin</code>.</p>
<p>The other way reading this database is via sqlite3, which is less convenient as the columns are not so descriptive, however it allows us an easy dump and offline review of the database. We can dump it as follows.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>csaby@mac ~ % sudo sqlite3 /var/db/auth.db .dump &gt; auth.txt
</code></pre><p>This will contain entries like the following:</p>

This requirement has nothing to do about who can obtain the right. Anyone satisfying the <code>rule</code> can get it. In this particular case it&rsquo;s set to <code>allow</code>, which means anyone asking for the right will obtain it.

</h2>
<p>Apple offers two main methods for applications to execute privilege actions. Using the <code>AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges</code> API, which is deprecated or using a factored application. A factored application means that we install a privileged helper tool through <code>launchd</code>, which runs as root, and we talk to this helper app through some form of IPC and asks action. The IPC is mostly XPC these days, however sockets, Mach, and Distributed Objects can be still found.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss briefly the deprecated API. This was extensively covered by Patrick Wardle in his <a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x55.html"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogpost</a>, I will only do a high level overview here.</p>
<p>When this API is invoked, an XPC message will be sent to the authorization daemon, <code>authd</code>. It will check the database for the <code>system.privilege.admin</code> rule, and if needed authenticate the user through <code>Security Server</code>. If authorization was successful, <code>security_authtrampoline</code> will be invoked to execute the required binary. <code>security_authtrampoline</code> is a SUID binary, owned by root, so it will run with root privileges. It will also verify the authorization info before execution.</p>
<p>This API is considered insecure, as <code>security_authtrampoline</code> won&rsquo;t perform any validation of the binary, and if it&rsquo;s writeable for the user, it opens the door for privilege escalations.</p>
<p>Moving on to factored applications, authorization can work through several ways. The recommended way doing this is using pre-authorization for better performance, however it&rsquo;s not strictly needed as it doesn&rsquo;t add extra security. The process is illustrated on Apple&rsquo;s flow chart I took from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/authorization_concepts/02authconcepts/authconcepts.html"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authorization Concepts</a> document.</p>
<p><img src="https://theevilbit.github.io/images/macos_authorization/privilegedapp_2x.png" alt="Pre-authorization flow in the main app"></p>
<p>The calling app has to create an empty <code>AuthorizationReference</code> first. If pre-authorization happening it needs to try to get authorization rights and ad it to the <code>AuthorizationReference</code>. When the application tries to obtain the rights it can chose if user prompting is allowed or not. However if user authentication is required by the specific rule for the given right, and the application doesn&rsquo;t allow prompting, the authorization will fail.</p>
<p>Next it needs to crate an <code>AuthorizationExternalForm</code> from the <code>AuthorizationReference</code>, and pass it to the helper tool. This external reference is a 32 byte long binary data, which, if guessed by any application it can be used and potentially lead to privilege escalation.</p>
<p>The helper tool process is shown on Apple&rsquo;s drawing.</p>
<p><img src="https://theevilbit.github.io/images/macos_authorization/helpertool_2x.png" alt="Authorization flow in helper tool"></p>
<p>The helper tool takes the <code>AuthorizationExternalForm</code> and converts it back to a <code>AuthorizationReference</code> and performs the authorization. If successful it will perform the privileged action.</p>
<p>I need to highlight that the authorization which is happening at the privilege helper tool is happening on behalf of the original client based on the reference. This is important as the helper tool runs as root, and as such it could get almost any right from the system. When performing authorization it can chose again to prompt for user authentication or not. If it was done in the main app already during preauthorization, there is no need for that, otherwise yes.</p>
<p>To give an example, let&rsquo;s examine the following logs. These are from my very first attempt to exploit F-Secure&rsquo;s XPC privileged helper tool, which I documented <a href="https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/secure_coding_xpc_part5/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> in more detail.</p>

</code></pre><p>F-Secure used pre-authorization for sensitive actions, and it prompted the user during that phase on the main application. As preauthentication already happened, the privileged helper had no need to prompt for user interaction. Thus if authentication wasn&rsquo;t performed before, the privilege helper failed, and this is what we see in the logs, where I didn&rsquo;t do preauthorization. The <code>fscsafeadmind.xpc</code> process tries to obtain the <code>system.privilege.admin</code> right. We can see next that the rule is being evaluated, and then it fails. The log clearly indicates that the authorization was performed for the client <code>F-Secure Mac Protection.app</code> (where I injected my dylib).</p>
<p>I still think that relying only on authorization only in privilege helper tools is not secure enough, as macOS users are used to get authentication prompts frequently and they will likely authenticate even if a malicious app asks for it. I discussed this in more detail <a href="https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/secure_coding_xpc_part1/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to document two issues I run into during exploit development, and it took me long time to figure out what&rsquo;s the problem, and why authorization fails.</p>
<p>If we run a binary from a TCC protected location, like <code>Desktop</code> authorization will fail. This is because <code>authd</code> doesn&rsquo;t have access to these places, and thus error out. Running the same application from <code>/tmp/</code> or any other place which is not privacy protected will work.</p>
<p>If we pass <code>AuthorizationExternalForm</code> via IPC to another process, we must wait till the target process consumes our request and performs authorization, as if the calling application exists too fast or uses <code>AuthorizationFree</code> on the original <code>AuthorizationReference</code> the <code>AuthorizationExternalForm</code> will be invalidated by the system, and thus authorization will fail.</p>
