      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I originally found the &lt;code&gt;mount_apfs&lt;/code&gt; bug back in December, 2019, I honestly had no idea what was the root cause of it, nor had a clue how to even start looking into it. The only thing I knew for sure that the answer is within kernel. My macOS knowledge was still quite fresh that time (and even today), and was busy with so many other stuff that I never had the time to start looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
