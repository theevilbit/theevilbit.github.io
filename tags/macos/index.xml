      <title>CVE-2022-22655 - TCC - Location Services Bypass</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-22655/</link>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-22655/</guid>
      <description>This is a quick blogpost about a vulnerability I covered in our Black Hat Europe 2022 talk with Wojciech Regula.
In contrary to what people would expect, clients which can access location services are not maintained in one of the TCC databased, but in a separate location, and it&amp;rsquo;s maintained by locationd. This has been also recently covered by Howard Oakley, in his Privacy: what TCC does and doesn’t blogpost.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-32929 - Bypass iOS backup&#39;s TCC protection</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-32929/</link>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2022-32929/</guid>
      <description>Intro Normally, when a users backup their iOS device, the backup is saved into ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup directory. The MobileSync directory is properly protected by TCC, as the backup can contain photos, contact information, everything from the iOS device, and it might be unencrypted, so this is a whole lot of private information. It&amp;rsquo;s only accessible with Full Disk Access rights.
The issue is that an attacker can invoke the AppleMobileBackup utility and make a backup to a custom location.</description>

      <description>Intro CVE-2017-2533 was part of a chain of vulnerabilities, used at pwn2own 2017 found by the phoenhex team. They wrote a blogpost about it here. This vulnerability led me to find CVE-2022-32780, which I detailed at Black Hat Asia 2022. Although the nature of CVE-2017-2533 was discussed by the authors, but the actual code part was never truly revealed, and I always wondered about the full details. Now I took the time to dig up the details, including how it was fixed, and why the fix solves the problem.</description>

      <description>Dropping some initial quick notes for a new security feature I ran into on macOS Ventura. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Launch Constraints&amp;rdquo; and lives inside AMFI.
Do the following experiment: Copy Terminal.app to your HOME folder and try to run it on Monterey and Ventura. On the former it will work without any issues, on the other it will fail, and we will get the following error:

I was watching an old BSidesLuxemburg 2019 talk by Aaron Jewitt, called &amp;ldquo;Threat Hunting On Linux And Mac With Auditbeat System Module&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s up on YouTube. Aaron mentioned in one of the slides that you can persist using man.conf files. It looked really odd, I tried to quickly Google it, but haven’t found anything about it.</description>

Folder action persistence has been documented by Cody Thomas back in 2019 in his blog. I think he did an awesome job, and everything he wrote still applies today. I wanted to take it a bit further and see if I can persist without any user prompts, and it turned out it is possible.</description>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2021-30808/</guid>
      <description>Intro CVE-2021-1784 was a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to bypass TCC by mounting over the ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC directory and providing a new TCC database. We covered this with Wojciech Regula in or 20+ ways to bypass your mac os privacy mechanisms BlackHat USA talk. This was properly fixed in Big Sur.
The Vulnerability I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I started to experiment with it again in the very first version of Monterey beta, and found that although the exploit doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, we can mount over the ~/Library directory.</description>

      <description>Intro This is a rather old vulnerability I found in TeamViewer back in 2020, and reported it through VCP/iDefense. TeamViewer fixed the vulnerability last November, but somehow I missed it, and became aware of it only recently. Their advisory can be found here: November updates - Security patches — TeamViewer Support
The TeamViewer macOS client used a PrivilegedHelperTool named com.teamviewer.Helper to perform specific tasks that require root permissions. Back in 2020 it used a deprecate model to perform IPC communication, called Distributed Objects.</description>

      <description>Since Apple started their Apple Security Bounty program I have submitted around 50 cases to their product security team. I thought I will share my experiences working with Apple in the past 2 years. This will be useful to anyone thinking about participating in the program, and will help setting up expectations.
Beyond Apple I do bug bounties also in other programs, like HackerOne, BugCrowd, VCP, ZDI or sometimes just working directly with vendors, so I have a good pool of other cases I can compare to.</description>

      <description>I plan to discuss two symlink attacks in this blog post. The first, more severe one, CVE-2020-9900 was reported by Zhongcheng Li (CK01) of Zero-dayits Team of Legendsec at Qi&amp;rsquo;anxin Group, and fixed in Catalina 10.15.6. Apple&amp;rsquo;s advisory said that with a symlink attack it was possible to elevate privileges. I never saw a public document about this bug, so I only assume that I will describe the actual issue here.</description>

TL;DR This technique is very similarly to Spotlight Importers, but heavily sandboxed. It’s even more limited as the user need to specifically want to preview the file.

TL;DR It works, but very limited due to heavy sandboxing, you can only read and copy files to your sandbox folder or consume some CPU power. If you have a way to escape sandbox then go for it, or could be used as part of a multi-part malware.</description>

Preference panes on macOS are plugins to the System Preferences.app. These panes can extend the functionality of the app, and typically allow you to modify configuration settings for your app. These admins are loaded when the user selects them, so they are not perfect from persistence point of view, as it requires user interaction, but can still be a thing.</description>

If the first part was about Terminal and shell profiles, it&amp;rsquo;s worth to mention iTerm2, which is a popular Terminal alternative on macOS. It&amp;rsquo;s being used by many people, especially power users.
When we start iTerm2 it starts the same shell environment as Terminal, and thus the same startup files apply here as well.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s an awesome series, which has 133 parts at the time of this writing. I find them pretty cool, and if you are doing either offensive or defensive work on Windows, this is a must read and follow blog.
In the past years as my interest in macOS grew, and now that I&amp;rsquo;m mostly doing only macOS related research and studies I started to came across many - many tricks, which allows someone to do persistence on macOS beyond just the LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents directories, which is used to store the launchd startup files.</description>

      <description>TL;DR On macOS 10.15.2 Apple introduced the com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation entitlement, which is slowly replacing the previously used com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation entitlement on system binaries. Although their impact is the about the same, the way they work is different. While library validation is automatically disabled using com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation, with com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation, the application has to disable it for itself through a csops system call.
Intro With the release of Big Sur, I noticed that many of the system binaries have a new entitlement, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t see before, and that is com.</description>

      <description>On macOS, one popular technique to inject code into other applications is leveraging the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable, which I wrote about in 2019 DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES DYLIB injection in macOS / OSX. This variable can store a colon-separated list of dynamic libraries to load before the ones specified in the target process.
Several limitations apply to when this injection technique can be used and when it cannot, which I also discussed. I revisited this topic, not only because things might have changed since then but also to ensure that I didn’t miss anything.</description>

This one will highlight why XPC client hardening and proper verification is extremely important when we use XPC messaging on macOS between clients that run as a normal user and services that run as root. If this validation is not right, it opens up the possibility for an attacker to run privileged commands or worse case, achieve full privilege escalation on the system.</description>

One application that came to my sight is Viscosity. This tool was already in Tyler Bohan&amp;rsquo;s list, where his team looked on exploiting such services: GitHub - blankwall/Offensive-Con: Talk and materials for Offensive Con presentation - Privileged Helper Tools.</description>

      <title>TALK - Exploiting directory permissions on macOS</title>

      <description>This research started around summer time in 2019, when everything settled down after my talk in 2019, where I detailed how did I gained root privileges via a benign App Store application, that I developed. That exploit used a symlink to achieve this, so I though I will make a more general approach and see if this type of vulnerability exists in other places as well on macOS systems. As it turns out it does exists, and not just on macOS directly but also on other apps, it appears to be a very fruitful of issue, without too much effort I found 5 exploitable bugs on macOS, 3 in Adobe installers.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-20057 - Secure coding XPC services - Part 1 - Why EvenBetterAuthorization is not enough?</title>

      <description>This is the first part of a blog post series I plan about PrivilegedHelperTools that exists on macOS systems. I recently took a look on a couple of these tools, and found that it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to make the code insecure, as there are many small pieces to it, and if one is done wrong, the helper tool will be open to abuse by anyone having a foothold on the system.</description>

      <title>GateKeeper - Bypass or not bypass?</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/gatekeeper_bypass_or_not_bypass/</link>

      <description>TL;DR On macOS Mojave Gatekeeper only verifies executables, which are run with the open command or the user double clicks. It won’t verify files, that are executed through other means like, directly executing a binary ./myapp regardless of the quarantine attribute. If you can place a plist file inside LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons, the command inside will also be executed. Prior to Catalina there is a way to trick users to drag &amp;amp; drop files in the LaunchAgents folder.</description>

      <title>NOCVE - Few click RCE via GitHub Desktop macOS client with Gatekeeper bypass and custom URL handlers</title>

      <description>TL;DR The GitHub Desktop app doesn’t add the quarantine extended attribute to files downloaded from the web, and this along with macOS’s URL handler auto-registration feature allows an attacker to execute arbitrary, even unsigned code on a macOS system. If we don’t count the clicks required to open the GitHub App, and cloning an external repository, then this is a 2 click RCE.
The idea I recently came across a very good blog post about an RCE vulnerability on GitHub Desktop: GitHub Desktop RCE (OSX) - André Baptista via its custom URL handlers.</description>

      <title>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES DYLIB injection in macOS / OSX</title>

      <description>After my recent blog post, my old mate @_Dark_Knight_ reached out to me and he asked me a question:
“Do you typically callout user apps that allow dyld_insert_libraries?”
And a few similar ones, and I will be honest, I had no idea what is he talking about, if only I understood the question :D Despite the fact that my recent blog posts and talks are about macOS, I deal much more with Windows on a daily basis, probably like 95%, and macOS is still a whole new territory for me.</description>

      <title>TALK - macOS - Getting root with benign AppStore apps</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/getting_root_with_benign_appstore_apps/</link>

      <description>This writeup is intended to be a bit of storytelling. I would like to show how I went down the rabbit hole in a quick ’research’ I wanted to do, and eventually found a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. I also want to show, tell about all the obstacles and failures I run into, stuff that people don’t talk about usually, but I feel it’s part of the process all of us go through, when we try to create something.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-14976 - GNS3 ubridge SETUID bit - arbitrary file read</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea of scanning my Mac for files that has the SUID bit set, I wanted to see if there is anything interesting showing up. You can do it this way:
/usr/bin/sudo find / -perm -4000 -exec /bin/ls -ldb {} \; &amp;gt; suidfilelist There was one item that caught my attention, and that was a file called ubridge inside GNS3. I used to be a network guy, and GNS3 is a great tool to emulate real network gear, practice configuration, etc.</description>
