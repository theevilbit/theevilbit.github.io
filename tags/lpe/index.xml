      <description>Intro Link to heading CVE-2017-2533 was part of a chain of vulnerabilities, used at pwn2own 2017 found by the phoenhex team. They wrote a blogpost about it here. This vulnerability led me to find CVE-2022-32780, which I detailed at Black Hat Asia 2022. Although the nature of CVE-2017-2533 was discussed by the authors, but the actual code part was never truly revealed, and I always wondered about the full details.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-30808 - CVE-2021-1784 strikes back - TCC bypass via mounting</title>

      <description>Intro Link to heading CVE-2021-1784 was a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to bypass TCC by mounting over the ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC directory and providing a new TCC database. We covered this with Wojciech Regula in or 20+ ways to bypass your mac os privacy mechanisms BlackHat USA talk. This was properly fixed in Big Sur.
The Vulnerability Link to heading I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I started to experiment with it again in the very first version of Monterey beta, and found that although the exploit doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, we can mount over the ~/Library directory.</description>

      <title>NOCVE - TeamViewer Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>

      <description>Intro Link to heading This is a rather old vulnerability I found in TeamViewer back in 2020, and reported it through VCP/iDefense. TeamViewer fixed the vulnerability last November, but somehow I missed it, and became aware of it only recently. Their advisory can be found here: November updates - Security patches — TeamViewer Support
The TeamViewer macOS client used a PrivilegedHelperTool named com.teamviewer.Helper to perform specific tasks that require root permissions.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-9900 &amp; CVE-2021-1786 - Abusing macOS Crash Reporter</title>

      <description>I plan to discuss two symlink attacks in this blog post. The first, more severe one, CVE-2020-9900 was reported by Zhongcheng Li (CK01) of Zero-dayits Team of Legendsec at Qi&amp;rsquo;anxin Group, and fixed in Catalina 10.15.6. Apple&amp;rsquo;s advisory said that with a symlink attack it was possible to elevate privileges. I never saw a public document about this bug, so I only assume that I will describe the actual issue here.</description>

      <description>When I originally found the mount_apfs bug back in December, 2019, I honestly had no idea what was the root cause of it, nor had a clue how to even start looking into it. The only thing I knew for sure that the answer is within kernel. My macOS knowledge was still quite fresh that time (and even today), and was busy with so many other stuff that I never had the time to start looking into it.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Link to heading We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the noowners flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc&amp;hellip;) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple&amp;rsquo;s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱
This could be achieved with a single command, for example: mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-14977 - Secure coding XPC Services - Part 5 - PID reuse attacks</title>

      <description>In the last post of the series we will see another typical issue, where XPC services using the connecting process&amp;rsquo;s ID (PID) to verify the client instead of the audit token. We will use F-Secure SAFE again for our case study, the vulnerability was fixed in 17.8 and it was assigned CVE-2020-14977.
The root cause Link to heading The XPC services of F-Secure SAFE use the process ID (PID) to verify the client&amp;rsquo;s signature, as can be seen in the code below.</description>

      <description>F-Secure SAFE XPC service exploitation (CVE-2020-14978) Link to heading Intro Link to heading In this post we will look into an other case study which will show us (again) why XPC client verification is crucial in XPC security, and how added authorization checks can slightly improve (but not fix) the problem. The F-Secure SAFE XPC services installed on macOS were not sufficiently hardened, and a malicious actor had the ability to interact with them.</description>

      <description>Microsoft AutoUpdate macOS privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2020-0984) Link to heading Introduction Link to heading This is the third post in my series which is trying to help Apple developers to avoid typical insecure coding practices. This one will highlight why XPC client hardening and proper verification is extremely important when we use XPC messaging on macOS between clients that run as a normal user and services that run as root.</description>

      <title>TALK - Exploiting directory permissions on macOS</title>

      <description>This research started around summer time in 2019, when everything settled down after my talk in 2019, where I detailed how did I gained root privileges via a benign App Store application, that I developed. That exploit used a symlink to achieve this, so I though I will make a more general approach and see if this type of vulnerability exists in other places as well on macOS systems. As it turns out it does exists, and not just on macOS directly but also on other apps, it appears to be a very fruitful of issue, without too much effort I found 5 exploitable bugs on macOS, 3 in Adobe installers.</description>

      <description>This is the first part of a blog post series I plan about PrivilegedHelperTools that exists on macOS systems. I recently took a look on a couple of these tools, and found that it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to make the code insecure, as there are many small pieces to it, and if one is done wrong, the helper tool will be open to abuse by anyone having a foothold on the system.</description>

      <description>IOBit’s Unlocker program is advertised to solve the following issues:
IObit Unlocker performs well in solving “cannot delete files”, “access is denied”, “The file is in use by another program or user”, or “There has been a sharing violation” problems. With IObit Unlocker, you can manage all your files the way you want.
and even:
With “Unlock &amp;amp; Delete”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Rename”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Move”, and “Unlock &amp;amp; Copy”, IObit Unlocker offers easier ways to unlock and manage the files and folders to keep them safe and available.</description>

      <description>Whenever you install an application on Windows, typically through MSI, there is a registry key created, with plenty of information for uninstallation, like the uninstaller location, install date, publisher, etc… you can find all of the options here: Add uninstall information to Add/Remove Programs - NSIS
In case an application is installed for the current user and not for all user, the Installation/Uninstallation details will go to the Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\ registry key instead of the HKLM hive.</description>

      <description>After my recent blog post, my old mate @_Dark_Knight_ reached out to me and he asked me a question:
“Do you typically callout user apps that allow dyld_insert_libraries?”
And a few similar ones, and I will be honest, I had no idea what is he talking about, if only I understood the question :D Despite the fact that my recent blog posts and talks are about macOS, I deal much more with Windows on a daily basis, probably like 95%, and macOS is still a whole new territory for me.</description>

      <title>TALK - macOS - Getting root with benign AppStore apps</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/getting_root_with_benign_appstore_apps/</link>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/getting_root_with_benign_appstore_apps/</guid>
      <description>This writeup is intended to be a bit of storytelling. I would like to show how I went down the rabbit hole in a quick ’research’ I wanted to do, and eventually found a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. I also want to show, tell about all the obstacles and failures I run into, stuff that people don’t talk about usually, but I feel it’s part of the process all of us go through, when we try to create something.</description>
