      <description>This is part 25 in the series of &amp;ldquo;Beyond the good ol&amp;rsquo; LaunchAgents&amp;rdquo;, where I try to collect various persistence techniques for macOS. For more background check the introduction.
Possibly a less known feature that macOS has a built-in Apache2 web server, which can be enabled anytime. Just as other Apache2 servers, it also supports the load of custom modules, and this is what we will explore here briefly for persistence.</description>

Folder action persistence has been documented by Cody Thomas back in 2019 in his blog. I think he did an awesome job, and everything he wrote still applies today. I wanted to take it a bit further and see if I can persist without any user prompts, and it turned out it is possible.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-30808 - CVE-2021-1784 strikes back - TCC bypass via mounting</title>

      <guid>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2021-30808/</guid>
      <description>Intro CVE-2021-1784 was a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to bypass TCC by mounting over the ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC directory and providing a new TCC database. We covered this with Wojciech Regula in or 20+ ways to bypass your mac os privacy mechanisms BlackHat USA talk. This was properly fixed in Big Sur.
The Vulnerability I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but I started to experiment with it again in the very first version of Monterey beta, and found that although the exploit doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, we can mount over the ~/Library directory.</description>

      <description>Many people used to ask me where to start learning about macOS security or exploitation, what are the trainings or books out there that can help with this topic. Nowadays there are a few trainings, which can get you started. Other great resources for macOS security are blog posts and conference talks.
I thought I will try to collect some resources that can help people to get started in this field.</description>

This is another application specific persistence method, related to the Terminal application.
In the Terminal Preferences, under the Profiles tab, we can set a command that will be executed upon Terminal&amp;rsquo;s startup. This is shown in the screen below.
This is stored inside Terminal&amp;rsquo;s preferences PLIST file, located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.</description>

This post has been long due, as it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite persistence tricks. Up until Big Sur 11.5 you could also exploit it for privilege escalation if Homebrew was installed on the system.
Periodic scripts have a FreeBSD origin. These scripts are doing some maintenance tasks on the system, and scheduled to be run on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.</description>

      <description>This post is about two techniques that can be useful for someone to evade GateKeeper in a red team engagement or pentest. According to Apple these are not considered bypasses, and everything works as expected.
mmap Part of GateKeeper is implemented on macOS in the Quarantine.kext kernel extension. It uses the MAC policy framework to insert hooks on the system on various points. These functions are named as hook*. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look on what is implemented.</description>

      <description>Apple announced macOS Monterey (macOS 12) this week at WWDC, and one of its new features that caught my eye is Shortcuts. It&amp;rsquo;s already available on iOS, but it made its way to macOS. My security focused brain immediately thought about how cool this feature could be for red teamers or pentesters to persist on macOS :) So I decided to take a quick look on the new functionality, focusing on how it works.</description>

Color pickers??? It&amp;rsquo;s this menu, where we can select a color:
To my surprise we can install our own color pickers on the system, and add custom ones. There are quite a few of these, some are even open source, like this: GitHub - viktorstrate/color-picker-plus: An Improved Color Picker for macOS.</description>

      <description>Intro This is a rather old vulnerability I found in TeamViewer back in 2020, and reported it through VCP/iDefense. TeamViewer fixed the vulnerability last November, but somehow I missed it, and became aware of it only recently. Their advisory can be found here: November updates - Security patches — TeamViewer Support
The TeamViewer macOS client used a PrivilegedHelperTool named com.teamviewer.Helper to perform specific tasks that require root permissions. Back in 2020 it used a deprecate model to perform IPC communication, called Distributed Objects.</description>

      <description>Since Apple started their Apple Security Bounty program I have submitted around 50 cases to their product security team. I thought I will share my experiences working with Apple in the past 2 years. This will be useful to anyone thinking about participating in the program, and will help setting up expectations.
Beyond Apple I do bug bounties also in other programs, like HackerOne, BugCrowd, VCP, ZDI or sometimes just working directly with vendors, so I have a good pool of other cases I can compare to.</description>

      <description>I plan to discuss two symlink attacks in this blog post. The first, more severe one, CVE-2020-9900 was reported by Zhongcheng Li (CK01) of Zero-dayits Team of Legendsec at Qi&amp;rsquo;anxin Group, and fixed in Catalina 10.15.6. Apple&amp;rsquo;s advisory said that with a symlink attack it was possible to elevate privileges. I never saw a public document about this bug, so I only assume that I will describe the actual issue here.</description>

TL;DR This technique is very similarly to Spotlight Importers, but heavily sandboxed. It’s even more limited as the user need to specifically want to preview the file.

Preference panes on macOS are plugins to the System Preferences.app. These panes can extend the functionality of the app, and typically allow you to modify configuration settings for your app. These admins are loaded when the user selects them, so they are not perfect from persistence point of view, as it requires user interaction, but can still be a thing.</description>

      <description>This is part 5 in the series of &amp;ldquo;Beyond the good ol&amp;rsquo; LaunchAgents&amp;rdquo;, where I try to collect various persistence techniques for macOS. For more background check the introduction.
PAM originated from Red Hat Linux, but made its way to most *nix based system, including macOS. It&amp;rsquo;s a modular system, that allows third party additions to various authentication related operations. I highly recommend checking out the FreeBSD documentation to get a full picture.</description>

cron is probably one of the most well known persistence mechanisms for macOS and basically any *nix operating system. It was originally developed for Unix back in 1975, and made its way to most platforms, which has Unix origins, like Linux, FreeBSD and thus macOS.</description>

To clear up some expectations. The below tweet is not about this method, that is deferred for now. :)
Login items are probably one of the most well documented methods to persist on macOS. It&amp;rsquo;s widely used by various application to launch themselves upon user login.</description>

If the first part was about Terminal and shell profiles, it&amp;rsquo;s worth to mention iTerm2, which is a popular Terminal alternative on macOS. It&amp;rsquo;s being used by many people, especially power users.
When we start iTerm2 it starts the same shell environment as Terminal, and thus the same startup files apply here as well.</description>

Shell startup files are executed when our shell environment like zsh or bash is starting up. macOS defaults to /bin/zsh these days, and whenever we open Terminal or SSH into the device, this is the shell environment we are placed into.</description>

      <description>I was always amazed by @Hexacorn&amp;rsquo;s Beyond good ol&amp;rsquo; Run key blog post series, which collects various persistence methods on Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s an awesome series, which has 133 parts at the time of this writing. I find them pretty cool, and if you are doing either offensive or defensive work on Windows, this is a must read and follow blog.
In the past years as my interest in macOS grew, and now that I&amp;rsquo;m mostly doing only macOS related research and studies I started to came across many - many tricks, which allows someone to do persistence on macOS beyond just the LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents directories, which is used to store the launchd startup files.</description>

      <description>TL;DR On macOS 10.15.2 Apple introduced the com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation entitlement, which is slowly replacing the previously used com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation entitlement on system binaries. Although their impact is the about the same, the way they work is different. While library validation is automatically disabled using com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation, with com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation, the application has to disable it for itself through a csops system call.
Intro With the release of Big Sur, I noticed that many of the system binaries have a new entitlement, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t see before, and that is com.</description>

      <description>TL;DR This blog post describes a generic technique I called internally on our red team assessment &amp;ldquo;Divide and Conquer&amp;rdquo;, which can be used to bypass behavioral based NextGen AV detection. It works by splitting malicious actions and API calls into distinct processes.
Intro Back in 2019 I was part of a red team, where our daily activity was to bypass a specific NextGen AV. I had this idea I called &amp;ldquo;divide and conquer&amp;rdquo;.</description>
