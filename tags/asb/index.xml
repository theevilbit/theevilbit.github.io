      <description>Since Apple started their Apple Security Bounty program I have submitted around 50 cases to their product security team. I thought I will share my experiences working with Apple in the past 2 years. This will be useful to anyone thinking about participating in the program, and will help setting up expectations.
Beyond Apple I do bug bounties also in other programs, like HackerOne, BugCrowd, VCP, ZDI or sometimes just working directly with vendors, so I have a good pool of other cases I can compare to.</description>
