    <p>My name is Csaba Fitzl or also known as &ldquo;theevilbit&rdquo;, which comes from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3514.txt"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 3514</a>. I graduated in 2006 as a computer engineer. I have worked for 6 years as a network engineer, troubleshooting and designing big networks. After that, I have worked for 8 years as a blue and red teamer focusing on network forensics, malware analysis, adversary simulation, and defense bypasses. Then I was working for OffSec and developed the <a href="https://www.offsec.com/courses/exp-312/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EXP-312: Advanced macOS Control Bypasses</a> course. Currently I&rsquo;m working for <a href="https://www.kandji.io/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kandji</a> as a Principal macOS Security Researcher.</p>
<p>I gave talks/workshops at various international IT security conferences, including Hacktivity, hack.lu, Troopers, SecurityFest, DEFCON, BlackHat USA and Objective By The Sea.</p>
<p>I spend my free time with the family, hiking or trail running in the mountains.</p>
