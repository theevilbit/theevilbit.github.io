      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research started around summer time in 2019, when everything settled down after my talk in 2019, where I detailed how did I gained root privileges via a benign App Store application, that I developed. That exploit used a symlink to achieve this, so I though I will make a more general approach and see if this type of vulnerability exists in other places as well on macOS systems. As it turns out it does exists, and not just on macOS directly but also on other apps, it appears to be a very fruitful of issue, without too much effort I found 5 exploitable bugs on macOS, 3 in Adobe installers. In the following post I will first go over the permission model of the macOS filesystem, with focus on the POSIX part, discuss some of the non trivial cases it can produce, and also give a brief overview how it is extended. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover every single detail of the permission model, as it would be a topic in itself, but rather what I found interesting from the exploitation perspective.&#xA;Then I will cover how to find these bugs, and finally I will go through in detail all of the bugs I found. Some of these are very interesting as we will see, as exploitation of them involves &amp;ldquo;writing&amp;rdquo; to files owned by root, while we are not root, which is not trivial, and can be very tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
