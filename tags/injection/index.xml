      <description>After my recent blog post, my old mate @_Dark_Knight_ reached out to me and he asked me a question:&#xA;“Do you typically callout user apps that allow dyld_insert_libraries?”&#xA;And a few similar ones, and I will be honest, I had no idea what is he talking about, if only I understood the question :D Despite the fact that my recent blog posts and talks are about macOS, I deal much more with Windows on a daily basis, probably like 95%, and macOS is still a whole new territory for me.</description>
